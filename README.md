# The system for finding the least resource intensive path in two or three dimensional space using machine learning with visualization of algorithms execution process

The system for finding the least resource intensive path in two or three dimensional space based on a self-learning neural network model with visualization of learning process. The universality of the system lies in the fact that the User can determine the script for its execution - choose the optimal learning algorithm, load or create the desired map of the area and set the logic of the object movement. To demonstrate these features of  software implementation of the system a user interface was developed. To make it easier for User to understand the used approaches it was decided to develop software implementation for visualizing the learning process of the genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning.
